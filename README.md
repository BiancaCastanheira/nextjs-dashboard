üß≠ **Next.js Dashboard App Tutorial**

This project is a result of following the official Next.js Learn Tutorial, designed to teach core concepts of building modern web applications using Next.js 14+ with the App Router. The tutorial walks through creating a feature-rich admin dashboard application with real-world patterns and modern tooling.

‚∏ª

üìö **_What I Learned_**

Throughout this tutorial, I explored and implemented:
‚Ä¢ App Router: File-based routing using the new app/ directory structure.
‚Ä¢ Layouts and Pages: Creating nested layouts for consistent UI.
‚Ä¢ Server and Client Components: Understanding the distinction and usage of each.
‚Ä¢ Data Fetching: Fetching data using async components and loading UI with Suspense.
‚Ä¢ Form Handling: Submitting and validating forms with built-in methods and useFormState.
‚Ä¢ Routing and Navigation: Using Link, useRouter, and dynamic routes.
‚Ä¢ Error Handling: Creating custom error.js components and leveraging error boundaries.
‚Ä¢ Optimizing UX: Adding loading states (loading.js) and optimistic UI updates.
‚Ä¢ Database Integration: Connecting to a database using Prisma ORM.
‚Ä¢ API Routes & Actions: Managing mutations and API logic with server actions.
